# Arvorian Training Simulator

## Project Details

Project Eos - or more commonly known as the Arvorian Training Simulator, is a mostly fully managed Rojo project for RSF.

Assets are managed using Remodel and are not tracked or synced using Rojo; this is due to poor performance on Rojo's end with 2-way sync of models.

- Roact; a declarative library for building UI,
- Robase; a powerful API-wrapper for Firebase's Realtime Database RESTful API,
- Rodux; state management library,
- Roact-Rodux; a bridge between Roact and Rodux,
- TestEZ; a BDD-style testing framework.

## Tooling
- Rojo; a project management tool,
- Selene; a blazing-fast modern Lua linter written in Rust,
- Roblox LSP; a Lua Language Server for Roblox,
- Remodel; a command line tool for manipulating Roblox files and the instances contained within them.
